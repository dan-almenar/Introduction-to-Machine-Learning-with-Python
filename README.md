# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-with-Python
###A two chapters **Jupyter Notebook based** introduction to Machine Learning with Python (SciKit Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly).

With this tutorial, you'll dive into Machine Learning with Python. It is availible in English and Spanish.

Instructions: Click the Jupyter Notebook of your choice and read on. If you want to code along, have a Jupyter Notebook up and ready and download/fork the .csv files from this repository.

No knowledge of Python or any of the used libraries is required to *understand* the content, as it is fully described, yet for practicing purpuses a mid level of Python is adviced.

###Note: This tutorial is still a work in progress. Chapters -as Jupyter Notebooks- will be added as they are finished.

Hope you enjoy it!

Dan.
